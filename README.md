# International Debt Statistics Analysis

In this project, we are going to analyze international dept data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of dept (in USD) owned by developing countries across several categories. We are going to find the answers to questions like:

What is the total amount of dept that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset? Which country owns the maximum amount of dept and what does that amount look like? What is the average amount of dept owed by countries across different debt indicators? 

The datasets used for this analysis was gotten from **kaggle.com**
